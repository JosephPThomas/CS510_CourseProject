# Deep Learning for Emergency Sound Classification
This research project aims to bridge gaps in real-time noise cancellation within emergency sound detection using deep learning. By integrating classification and denoising models, we propose a unique approach to prioritize critical auditory signals amidst noisy environments, with potential applications in industrial sensing and consumer electronics. Ultimately, this endeavor seeks to increase advancements in technology to enhance public safety and well-being.
